# console-finances
A console that analyses company datasets to produce various calculations about the company's finances.

## Description
In this project we were given a dataset surrounding a company's finances, within an array with two fields. One of the fields was the month and year, and the other was the profit/loss for the month. 

Utilisng Javascript functions, we were tasked with generating various calculations for the company's finances, including the number of months, the total net profit/loss over the entire period, the average change, as well as the greatest and lowest change in profit and losses. These calculations were to be displayed in the console log once completed.
